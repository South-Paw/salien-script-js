## üïπÔ∏è How to use this

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). (Version 10 and above)
2. Log into [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) in your browser.
3. Open the following URL: <https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken>. You should be able to find the bit that looks like `"token":"xxxxxxxx"`. Copy whatever is inside the second quotes, (e.g. `xxxxxxxx`).
4. Open PowerShell on Windows. (Tip: Start > Run > type `powershell.exe` > Enter)
5. Run `npm install -g salien-script-js` to install this project.
6. Run the script by typing `salien-script-js --token xxxxxxxx` where `xxxxxxxx` is your token from step 3.

> ### Remeber to drop us a ‚≠ê star on the project if you appreciate this script!

## üòç How to update the script

1. Close/cancel any running script windows
2. Open PowerShell on Windows.
3. Run `npm i -g salien-script-js`
4. Re-run your scripts using the same command

Easy right?

### üëå Represent your Steam Group (Optional)

If you'd like to represent a specific steam group, simply pass the `--group` option with the ID of the group.

```sh-session
salien-script-js --token xxxxxxxx --group 123456789
```

You can get your group id by going to https://steamcommunity.com/groups/YOUR_GROUP_NAME_HERE/memberslistxml/?xml=1 and replacing `YOUR_GROUP_NAME_HERE` with the group name shown at the end of your groups url.

**You must be a member of a group to represent that group!**

If you'd like to team up with an established larger group please consider using either:

* [/r/saliens](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/summersaliens) id: `103582791462557324`
* [SteamDB](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamdb) id: `103582791434298690`
* [100Pals](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/100pals) id: `103582791454524084`

### üåå Select a planet (Optional)

If you would like to override planet selection in favor of a particular one, provide the `--planet` CLI option with the planet ID.

```sh-session
salien-script-js --token xxxxxxxx --planet 15
```

---

### üë• Multiple tokens/scripts

Simply open another PowerShell window and run `salien-script-js --token yyyyyyyy --name "name of this script"` where `yyyyyyyy` is your other accounts token and `name of this script` if what you'd like to see in the log outputs.
